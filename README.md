# PennX-SD2x

This repository is for the assigments I did on Data Structures and Software Design course on edX by University of Pennsylvania.

Course Description:

This course, part of the CS Essentials for Software Development Professional Certificate program, will take your skills to the next level by teaching you how to write “good” software that appropriately represents and organizes data, is easy to maintain, and is of high quality.
